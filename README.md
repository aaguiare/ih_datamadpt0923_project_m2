## **Ironhack Data PT MAD - Project Module 2**

This README file includes the details of the repository elements required for the module 2 project within Data Analytics Bootcamp in Ironhack Madrid.
The project consists of creating a dashboad data visualization that shows volcano activity from Holocene period and detail of the most active volcanic countries. 

**Data**

- CSV with the dataset to visualize (located in the data folder) 

**Resources in this repository**

This repository will include the following elements (apart from the ones defined in **Data**): 

- Data model of dataset(located in main resources folder)
- Mockup of the visual dashboard (located in main resources folder)
- Link to the Tableau Public dashboard in the main.txt file 

```

👀**Context**

This repository is the final project for Module 2 project for the Part Time Data Analytics Bootcamp in November 2023, which had the following requirements: 

Challenge 1: BI Report/Dashboard

BI Reports and Dashboards are powerful tools for communicating important information at-a-glance. The goal of this challenge is to build a BI Report/Dashboard using a dataset of your choice. Bear in mind the purpose of the report and build a normalized model that fits your visualization requeriments and interactivity performance.

You may use either Tableau or Power BI as your main tool for creating your reporting app. There are not restictions about the data source location or format (local drive, database, multiformat, etc.).

A BI Report/Dashboard is not exactly a sequential set of descriptive charts. Instead, a BI Report/Dashboard should be a single interactive interface built around a specific objetive and which components are logically arranged in order to provide data relevant insights effectively.

💣 **Reporting Architecture**

1. Data Extraction and Cleaning:

Imported the dataset from Kaggle into Tableau.
Conducted a thorough cleaning process to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. Data Exploration:

Utilized Tableau's exploratory data analysis features to understand the distribution and patterns within the dataset.
Identified key variables for analysis, such as eruption types, locations, and magnitudes.

3. Dashboard Design:

Designed an intuitive dashboard with a user-friendly interface for easy navigation.
Incorporated interactive filters to allow users to explore specific time periods, regions, and eruption characteristics.

4. Visual Elements:

Implemented a variety of visual elements, including maps, charts, and graphs, to effectively communicate different aspects of volcanic eruptions.
Utilized color coding to highlight critical information and trends.

5. Functionalities:

- Time Series Analysis:

    Implemented a time slider to visualize volcanic activities over different time periods.
    Included a dynamic timeline chart to display the frequency of eruptions.

- Geospatial Mapping:

    Integrated an interactive map to display the geographical distribution of volcanic eruptions.
    Users can zoom in on specific regions and click on markers for detailed information.

- Eruption Characteristics:

    Created charts to showcase the distribution of eruption types, magnitudes, and durations.

- Impact Analysis:

    Visualized the impact of eruptions by incorporating charts depicting casualties, damage, and associated events.

💩 **ToDo**

As next steps and continuous improvements: 

- Improve data granularity and add more insightful visualizations.
